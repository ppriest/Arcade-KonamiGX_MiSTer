# Clocks: one PLL, counters 0..3 = clk_sys 96 MHz, SDRAM_CLK (96 MHz at 180
# degrees), clk_vid 48 MHz, clk_cpu 24 MHz, all at phase 0 except the SDRAM
# pin's. derive_pll_clocks makes them related clocks, so every path between
# the board (clk_vid), the 68EC020 (clk_cpu) and the memory (clk_sys) is
# timed at the two clocks' closest edges. No exception is needed and none is
# made: rtl/gx_main.sv's cpu_cen and rtl/memory/gx_rom_port.sv are written
# for related clocks, not for asynchronous ones.

# PLL counter for the pin, same module on the same board.

# SDRAM I/O TIMING -- so that STA can SEE the data-capture path at all.
#
# Until this block existed every SDRAM pin was "No input delay ... found" in
# the STA report: the sdram.sv capture registers are packed into the I/O
# cells (FAST_INPUT_REGISTER, sys.tcl), which fixes their location, but the
# pin-to-register setup/hold against the memory's clock was never checked.
# The capture edge at those IOEs moves with whatever global clock network the
# Fitter routes clk_sys over, and that choice changes from build to build.
# Measured consequence: a functionally inert RTL change produced a build on
# which bit 8 of the FIRST beat of every SDRAM read burst read 1 where the
# ROM held 0, in roughly half of samples (scripts/sdram_check.py), while STA
# reported every clock positive. The good and bad builds differed in nothing
# STA was looking at.
#
# CLOCKS. clk_sys is the main PLL's counter 0 (96 MHz). SDRAM_CLK is counter
# 1, the same 96 MHz shifted 180 degrees, wired straight to the pin. The
# memory launches and samples on SDRAM_CLK; the FPGA does both on clk_sys.
#
# NUMBERS ARE ASSUMED, NOT MEASURED, and are variables for that reason. They
# are MT48LC16M16A2 -7E values at CL=2 (tAC 6.0, tOH 2.7, tDS 1.5, tDH 0.8 ns)
# plus a nominal board/pin allowance, because three attempts to fetch the
# datasheet failed. The DE10-nano SDRAM module's actual part and speed grade
# are not recorded anywhere in this repository. Calibrate from the datasheet
# before treating a negative slack here as a hard failure -- until then this
# block is an INSTRUMENT: run quartus_sta on two fits and compare the slack
# on SDRAM_DQ[*], which is what it was written for.

# THE FIRST BEAT IS CAPTURED TWO clk_sys EDGES AFTER THE MEMORY'S LAUNCH EDGE,

# drives the first word CL=2 memory clocks after that, and dq_in captures it
# on the clk_sys edge after the one STA would assume. Measured on the fit this
# was calibrated against: data arrival 28.0 ns against a single-cycle
# requirement of 18.8 (-9.2 ns), against the second edge +0.65 ns. That
# sub-nanosecond margin on beat 0 is the whole reason a capture register
# placed in the fabric, with 5-10 ns of routing in front of it, failed on
# hardware while an I/O-cell register passes. Hold is checked against the
